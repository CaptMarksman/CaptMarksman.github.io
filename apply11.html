		<p>When trying to build good credit it is important to develop consistency. You should always be consistent with you spending, consistent with your payments and consistent with applying for new credit. In other words, spending a lot of money at once can cause your credit score to go down because your cards will have higher balances. Not making your payments consistently will cause you credit score to go down because you will have late payments reported on your credit report. Finally, applying for several new credit lines in a short period of time will also make your credit score go down. Its best to spread out your spending, spread out your new credit applications and most of all, always make your payments on time. It may take some time to build a good credit score and history, but consistency is key, and with time you will get there.</p>
